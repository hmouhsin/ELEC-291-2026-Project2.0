## Project Overview

This project involves designing, building, programming, and testing a remote-controlled autonomous robot capable of detecting and picking up metal coins from a playing field. The robot uses a metal detector (Colpitts oscillator) to locate coins and an electromagnet to pick them up. It must stay within a defined perimeter boundary using inductive sensors, and can operate in both manual (remote-controlled) and autonomous modes.

The system consists of two separate microcontroller-based units — a **robot** and a **remote controller** — that communicate wirelessly via JDY-40 radio modules. Both units must use microcontrollers from **different families** and be fully **battery powered**.

- All code written in **C** (no Arduino environment)

---

## Robot Subsystems

### Power Regulation
- 4×AA batteries (6V) power the motors directly via the H-bridge
- LM7805 regulates down to 5V for logic
- MCP1700 regulates down to 3.3V for microcontroller and JDY-40
- MBR150 diodes used for power source switching (USB vs battery)
- Add decoupling capacitors per LM7805 and MCP1700 datasheets
- **Do NOT connect the ground of the motor circuit to the ground of the logic circuit** — use optocouplers for isolation

### H-Bridge Motor Driver
- One H-bridge per motor (two total)
- Uses one P-MOSFET and one N-MOSFET per side
- LTV-847 optocouplers isolate microcontroller signals from motor power rail
- RD = 1kΩ, RT = 10kΩ (per the provided design)
- Microcontroller drives 4 PWM output pins total (2 per motor)
- CW rotation: top P-MOSFET and bottom N-MOSFET on opposite sides conduct
- CCW rotation: opposite pair conducts

### Metal Detector — Colpitts Oscillator
- Uses 1mH ferrite core inductor (DigiKey M8275-ND) — handle carefully, core breaks if dropped
- Component values: R = 100Ω–1kΩ, C1 = 1nF–10nF, C2 = 10nF–100nF, L = 1mH
- Requires **5V supply** — PMOS threshold voltage too high for 3.3V
- Use a 5V-tolerant input pin on the microcontroller
- When metal is brought near the inductor, inductance changes slightly, shifting the oscillator frequency
- Microcontroller measures frequency via timer/capture interrupt
- Establish a baseline frequency, trigger coin detection when frequency shifts beyond a threshold
- Discrete CMOS inverter can be built using one NMOS + one PMOS if a logic IC is not available

### Electromagnet
- Activated when coin is detected
- Holds coin during robot movement, deactivated to release
- Assembly instructions provided on Canvas

### Perimeter Detector
- Two identical circuits mounted **perpendicular** to each other on the robot
- Each circuit: pickup inductor → amplifier → peak detector → ADC input
- When inductor gets close to the perimeter wire, peak detector output voltage increases
- Two perpendicular sensors ensure the wire is always detected regardless of approach angle
- ADC reads both channels continuously in auto mode
- When either channel exceeds threshold: back up, turn, resume navigation
- Perimeter signal source: 555 timer in astable configuration + 47Ω series resistor + 9V battery (preferred over function generator for portability)

---

## Remote Subsystems

### Power Regulation
- 9V battery → LM7805 → 5V for LCD and logic
- MCP1700 → 3.3V for JDY-40
- Add decoupling capacitors

### LCD Display
- 6 digital output pins from microcontroller
- Parallel interface, bit-banged
- Displays: current mode (manual/auto), coin count, battery level, signal status

### Joystick
- Two potentiometers (X and Y axes) → 2 ADC inputs on microcontroller
- **Note:** Joystick pins are not breadboard compatible out of the box — solder short hookup wires to pins, bend perpendicular, then plug into breadboard
- ADC values mapped to motor direction and speed commands

### Speaker
- Single PWM output pin
- Generates tones for: coin detected, perimeter hit, mode switch, low battery warning

---

## Wireless Communication

### JDY-40 Radio Module
- Operating voltage: **3.3V only** — double check polarity before powering
- Interface: UART (TXD, RXD, SET) — 3 pins
- Maximum baud rate: **9600 baud**
- Pin pitch is 2mm — breadboard holes are 2.54mm:
  1. Bend header pins to match 2mm spacing
  2. Solder header on top of JDY-40
  3. Plug into breadboard
- **Set a unique device ID** for your pair to avoid interference with other groups:
```c
  SendATCommand("AT+DVIDxxxx\r\n"); // xxxx = 0000 to FFFF in hex
```
- JDY-40 should have a dedicated hardware UART if available
- For micros without a spare hardware UART (ATMega328p, MSP430G2553): use timer ISR software UART — examples on Canvas

### Command Protocol
Define a simple byte-based command set, for example:
```
0x01 — Forward
0x02 — Backward
0x03 — Left
0x04 — Right
0x05 — Stop
0x06 — Auto mode on
0x07 — Auto mode off
0x08 — Coin detected (robot → remote)
```

### JDY-40 Wiring by Microcontroller
| Microcontroller | TXD | RXD | SET |
|----------------|-----|-----|-----|
| EFM8 | P0.0 | P0.1 | P2.0 |
| ATMega328P | PB2 | PB1 | PD4 |
| MSP430G2553 | P2.1 | P2.2 | P2.0 |
| LPC824 | PIO0-9 | PIO0-8 | PIO0-1 |
| STM32L051 | PA14 | PA13 | PA15 |
| PIC32MX130 | B15 | B14 | B13 |

Add 1kΩ series resistors on all JDY-40 signal lines for protection.

---

## Playing Field Setup

- Minimum area: **0.5 m²**
- Recommended surface: Con-Tact non-adhesive shelf liner (clear diamonds, 60"×20") from Home Depot (~$17) — good grip, easy to roll and transport, fits lab benches
- Perimeter wire laid around the boundary of the playing field
- Coins scattered inside the perimeter
- Perimeter signal source (555 timer circuit) placed outside the field, wire looped around the perimeter

---

## Operating Modes

### Manual Mode
- Remote joystick directly controls robot movement
- Joystick X/Y ADC values → direction and speed commands → transmitted via JDY-40 → robot executes motor control
- Speaker and LCD on remote provide feedback

### Automatic Mode
- Robot navigates the field independently
- State machine:
  1. **Searching** — drive forward, scanning for metal
  2. **Coin Detected** — stop, activate electromagnet, pause
  3. **Resuming** — deactivate electromagnet, continue searching
  4. **Perimeter Hit** — back up, turn away, resume searching
- Remote can start/stop auto mode and display live status


---
### Important Notes
- **Do not copy/paste block diagrams from the project spec** — redraw your own, it takes 5 minutes in Word
- Do not append datasheets or compiler manuals
- Document circuit values, ADC thresholds, and PWM settings in real time — don't try to reconstruct them after the fact
- The detailed design section is where most of the report marks come from — give every subsystem a proper circuit diagram and written explanation

## Bonus Features

These features go beyond the base requirements and are what push a demo score from 7.5 into the 8–10 range. All are achievable within the project timeline and all work with a standard breadboard setup. Total hardware cost for all of them is around $29, or roughly $5 per person.

---

### HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Obstacle Avoidance
**What it does:** Detects objects in the robot's path and stops or steers around them in auto mode.

**Hardware:** HC-SR04 sensor module (~$4 on Amazon). 4-pin, 2.54mm pitch, plugs directly into breadboard. Runs on 5V.

**Software:** Two GPIO pins — one trigger, one echo. Send a 10µs pulse on trigger, measure the pulse width on echo. Distance = pulse width × speed of sound / 2. Stop or turn when distance drops below threshold.

**Difficulty:** 2/5 | **Time:** 3–4 hours

**Why it's worth it:** Adds genuine autonomous functionality. Directly addresses the "additional functionality" criterion in the marking rubric.

---

### OLED Display on Remote
**What it does:** Replaces the standard LCD with a crisp graphical OLED — display coin count, battery level, signal strength, robot mode, and simple graphics all at once.

**Hardware:** SSD1306 0.96" I2C OLED (~$5 on Amazon). 4 pins (VCC, GND, SDA, SCL), plugs straight into breadboard. **Buy the 4-pin I2C version specifically.**

**Software:** I2C interface with SSD1306 library. Initialize in 2–3 lines of code. Draw text, rectangles, lines, and bitmap icons with simple function calls. Far simpler than the 6-pin parallel LCD interface.

**Difficulty:** 1/5 | **Time:** 1–2 hours

**Why it's worth it:** Looks dramatically more professional than the LCD for almost zero effort. For a team that has driven a VGA display in C, this is trivial.

---

### ESP32-CAM Live FPV Stream
**What it does:** Mounts a small camera on the robot and streams live video over WiFi. Anyone in the room can open a browser on their phone and watch the robot's perspective in real time during the demo.

**Hardware:** ESP32-CAM module + programmer board (~$10 on Amazon, usually sold as a bundle). Solder 4 jumper wires to connect to breadboard power rails.

**Software:** Flash the pre-built CameraWebServer firmware — built into Arduino IDE under File → Examples → ESP32 → Camera → CameraWebServer. Change two lines (WiFi SSID and password). Flash it. Done. No custom code required.

**Setup steps:**
1. Install Arduino IDE and add ESP32 board support
2. Open CameraWebServer example
3. Set your phone hotspot SSID and password
4. Hold IO0 pin to GND while powering on to enter flash mode
5. Flash firmware, open serial monitor to get the IP address
6. Anyone on the same hotspot opens that IP in a browser — live video

**Difficulty:** 1/5 | **Time:** 2–3 hours (mostly first-time Arduino IDE setup)

**Why it's worth it:** Completely standalone — doesn't touch your main microcontroller code at all. Best effort-to-impressiveness ratio of any bonus feature on this list. Watching the robot's POV on your phone during a live demo is genuinely memorable.

---

### Web Telemetry Dashboard (Wemos D1 Mini)
**What it does:** Robot broadcasts live telemetry to a webpage — coin count, battery voltage, current mode, perimeter sensor readings, motor speeds — accessible by anyone on the same WiFi network.

**Hardware:** Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 (~$5 on Amazon). **Buy the D1 Mini version, not the bare ESP-01 module.** Standard 2.54mm headers, plugs straight into breadboard. Connects to robot microcontroller via UART.

**Software:** D1 Mini runs a lightweight web server. Robot microcontroller sends telemetry packets over UART to the D1 Mini, which formats and serves them as a live-updating webpage. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the dashboard frontend.

**Difficulty:** 3/5 | **Time:** 5–6 hours

**Why it's worth it:** Shows genuine systems integration thinking beyond the base requirements. A live updating dashboard with real sensor data is the kind of feature that earns the "exceptional" descriptor on the marking rubric.

---

### Coin Heatmap
**What it does:** Robot tracks approximate position using dead reckoning (motor commands + timing) and remembers where coins were found. In subsequent auto mode runs it focuses effort on previously productive areas and skips zones that were already cleared.

**Hardware:** No additional hardware required.

**Software:** Maintain a simple 2D grid array representing the playing field. Update estimated position based on motor direction and timing. Mark grid cells where coins are detected. Bias autonomous navigation toward unvisited or previously productive cells.

**Difficulty:** 3/5 | **Time:** 4–5 hours

**Why it's worth it:** Demonstrates actual intelligent behavior beyond simple random search. Visually explainable during the demo — "it already picked that area clean so it's moving over here."

---

### Live Minimap on OLED
**What it does:** The OLED on the remote shows a live top-down minimap of the playing field with a dot representing the robot's current estimated position, updating in real time as it moves.

**Hardware:** OLED display (same as above). Robot sends position estimates to remote via JDY-40.

**Software:** Dead reckoning on robot side — track X/Y position from motor commands and timing. Transmit coordinates to remote over JDY-40. Remote renders position as a pixel on the OLED display — essentially a small framebuffer problem.

**Difficulty:** 3/5 | **Time:** 4–5 hours

**Why it's worth it:** For a team with VGA display experience, this is a natural extension of skills you already have. Dead reckoning + wireless telemetry + real-time graphical rendering is a compelling technical combination that stands out.

---

### Smartphone Control via Bluetooth (HC-05)
**What it does:** Control the robot directly from a phone via Bluetooth, either as a replacement for or alongside the JDY-40 joystick remote.

**Hardware:** HC-05 Bluetooth module (~$5 on Amazon). Comes on a breakout board with 2.54mm headers, plugs straight into breadboard. Standard UART interface — identical to how the JDY-40 is wired.

**Software:** Pair phone to HC-05. Use a free Bluetooth terminal app to send command bytes. Robot decodes them identically to JDY-40 commands — almost no new robot-side code required.

**Difficulty:** 2/5 | **Time:** 3–4 hours

**Why it's worth it:** Controlling the robot from a phone during the demo impresses observers immediately. Can run alongside the existing JDY-40 remote as a secondary control interface with minimal additional work.
